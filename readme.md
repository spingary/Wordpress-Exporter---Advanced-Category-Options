# Wordpress Exporter Advanced Options

This WordPress plugin adds a custom export profile to the [Wordpress Exporter](http://www.ground6.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-exporter/) plugin. 
The added profile allows you to include AND exclue posts from one or more category of posts.  This can be useful,
for example, if you need to export posts that are in the category "News" but omit those that area also in the "Alerts" category.

See http://www.ground6.com/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-exporter for the Wordpress Exporter plugin.
